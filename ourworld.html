<p>Life could be beautiful, or life could be ugly - But that’s on you.</p>

<p>Is the world too scary, too evil, too awful, too ugly to bear? Good. That means your soul is working. </p>

<p>If it were any other way, I’d find it rather hard not to splatter my brains immediately. Imagine living in a perfect world. Nothing to do. No reason to do anything at all. Nothing left to do. But this isn’t our reality.</p>

<p>By whose hands are the evils of the world done by? By men, who share in the same spirit and flesh as you and I. Consider an evil of mankind:</p>

<p>Rape. The pleasure one takes in overpowering the weak. The excitement of freely pleasuring oneself with a woman. To do as one pleases with her, knowing there’s nothing preventing him from doing with a human life as he pleases. For his own pleasure. To look into his victims eyes, witness the breaking of her spirit, and love it. Even more pleasurable to witness her breaking for the first time. Then to realize you’re very hands are capable of it, at this very moment - and knowing that you yourself, and all mankind, would actually enjoy doing it. It’s ingrained into our very nature.</p>

<p>Who said life shouldn’t be painful? No one has ever hit the grave without enduring the pain of existence. Who said anything about what life should be at all? That’s their opinion. </p>

<p>To tell anyone how life should be is slavery. The worst kind. Broken bones and labor are paradise to the man with a broken spirit.</p>

<p>Ponder on those who find it justified to sit at the throne of god: judging what’s right for someone else. In the same way a man tells a child that it is best for the child not to tell Mommy and Daddy that preacher man touched him.</p>

<p>Your truth. Only you can understand your existence. </p>

<p>Now consider this: by whose hands does our worlds pain & evil come from? </p>

<p>Mankind itself.</p>

<p>If you’d like to play this game of evil, start by asking what would make you happy. What benefits you. Who you can judge. How can you play God. What to steal. What’s the silver bullet. Let’s plunder life for all it’s got. Riches. Power. Wealth. Fame. Pleasure. Fantasies.</p>

<p>To make this world less painful, less ugly, less evil: start by asking what can you do for the next human being you encounter. How could one possibly make existence better? Pick a load to carry for the sake of others. Start there. </p>

<p>You’re able to decide this instant to take responsibility for the evils of the world. They’re as much your fault, as they are mine, as they are of other men. Because you know what their capable of - and your capable of the same.</p>

<p>Imagine someone had watched your mother being raped. They tell you: “Yeah, seemed like there was nothing I could do, my bad. I just bailed.” Is that idle person more or less deserving of your wrath than the ones who committed the first evil?</p>

<p>I agree, our world is shitty. But it’s our shitty world. That we created. And when we all meet our fate of joining the divine, this will be the world we left behind. </p>

<p>If you can go to the grave, knowing you’ve taken up your post as a rational being, resisted the traps of evil men and done all you could with what you’ve been given: that’s all that the divine & your own soul alike could ever ask of you.</p>

<p>But how you leave the world: that’s on you. And only you. And will always belong to you. </p>

<p>Choose wisely, because it’s a game with the highest stakes.</p>

<p>The wager: your life.</p>

<p>To win it: the sweetest of all victories.</p>

<p>To lose it: a living hell.</p>
