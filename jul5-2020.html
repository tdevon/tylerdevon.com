<p>
	Although derailed from computers momentarily, I'm now realizing more and more my life task and calling is aimed in this area. It has always seemed computers have been my only strong suit, the only constant in my lifetime. Because of this natural interest and preclination, I beleive this is where I should dedicate my time to.
</p>
<p>
I recognize the false paths that exist: money, fame, recognition, get-rich-quick, etc. Yet, all of these things will not only leave me empty inside if I were to acheive their ends, but more importantly, are usually impossible in pursuit of them directly. It is better to pick my calling, then pursue that to its ends, because it will be pursued for the sake of itself.
</p>

<p>
I find computer science, philosophy and writing to be my strong suits. Not only am I great at each of these, but more importantly, they have captivative my full interests. The potential each has at improving lives and creating a lasting impact is too grand to leave behind in pursuit for the sake of anything else. Not only that, but I've always been willing to pursue them for the sake of itself. There should be no need to "sell out" for money or pursuit in external things when pursuing these.
</p>

<p>
For example, I was trying to fill a hole when starting my business. There was no passion there. When creating music, although fuffilling, I was attempting at filling a hole that was there in fame and money. It seemed worth pursuing with my learned ability of attempting mastery, however, my energy was not there. Yet, with computers, my energy is fully there. I don't need adderall to fuel it, just my childhood interest in the topic.
</p>

<p>It was ultimatley nessisary to quit adderall. I needed to see I could actually do it without drugs, I truly do love the subject. However, maybe it was adderall to give me the spark of interest and confidence in actually learning these subjects. In any case, I beleive it was a nessisary evil to get to where I am now. I am able to write and pursue these skills endlessly, without the need of a substance. ADditionally, Adderall slowed me down and pulled me down to dark places. It wasn't sustainable, and additionally had me hyper-focus on the wrong things. Now, with a sober mind, I'm more able to pursue computers with a pure consious.</p>
