<h1>The Journey Continunes</h1>
<h4>Tyler H. Devon. 07-03-20.</h4>
<hr/>

<p>
	Today, I will start my return to programming. Although I've taken a lot of time off, unfortunatley, programming seems to be where my heart is at. I'm not sure what it is about coding that draws me in, however, from being a passtime to a place I might want to call my career, I have decidley embarked on pursing this interest.
</p>

<p>For some time, I've been lured in off my path by monetary gains. Yet, I beleive money is a false deterent from finding true satisfaction in life. THe pursuit of money will ultimetley leave me unfuffiled. I know this to be true, out of all things. Between the pursuit of money, fame, appeal of others, and other misleading traps of the external, to find my true calling in this life time, I must go with what my heart is telling me.
</p>

<p>To start on this adventure, I beleive first it may be best to touch up on my python skills. For this, I will follow the python documentation. I will try my best to stay away from tutorials and other types of content, as I don't want to get locked in "tutorial purgatory". Essentially, this dreaded place is where programmers are left to die. Where although one feels like they are accomplishing a lot, in reality, they are simply following along with what the instructor is telling them. To gain real talent in programming, I beleive the student is responsible for embarking on figuring this out for themselves.</p>

<h3>The 30 Day plan</h3>

<p>Within 30 days, I would like to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Complete the python documentation tutorial</li>
	<li>Build 3-5 projects in python</li>
	<li>Learn Unix/Linux</li>
	<li>Learn the basics of networks/security</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these goals are rough, broad goals, I beleive they will at least put me in the direction for now on my road to mastery.</p>

<p>The question of the day is which is more satisifying and adds meaning to ones life: the pursuit of wealth, or the pursuit of mastery?</p>
