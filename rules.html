<h1>Rules & The Inner Critic</h1>

<p>
Who is worthy to sit on throne of God? To look down upon the people of the world, with foreknowledge of all things both good and evil. This role implies bearingthe responsibility for all things, good and evil alike. That because all things are derived from his finger, he ultimatley understands compleltley the nature in all things. Just as a writer, a painter, a craftsman, a teacher, or any alike understand their own creations. Not because of any decision to take the role of understanding their craft, but rather, an almost inate quality that comes with the act of bringing something new into existance. As a writer knows why he choose a particular adjective, word, phrase, plot twist or any other element - the knowledge of what he created naturally comes about during the act of developing the story.</p>

<p>So to what extent could one be truthful in declaring their knowledge of something created not by their own hands? Of course, we have institutions to ensure the transfer of knowledge accumilated by mankind over time. Yet, one could read Shakespear and understand the plotline: but why Shakespeare wrote what he did, is only within his own mind.</p>

<p>For anyone else to tell shakespear why he wrote what he wrote, they'd have to watch the romping of his mind during the act of writing his works. Yet, this doesn't prove truthful enough. Shakespear was a man; eating, drinking, thinking, talking to others. All the natural characteristics of a human being. Would all of these actions not also require one to observe, in order to truly tell Shakespear why he wrote what he did? An upsetting encounter with a neighbor could influence his penmanship, including a subtle diss twords in anger against his neighbor. A sneakly line, intended for no one other than the authors pleasure, self-interest, pain, or all the rest.</p>

<p>Yet, no man would be able to fill the soles of his shoes. Not because of their size or physical qualities, but rather each man already has his own pair of shoes. Without unbuckling ones own shoe, it proves impossible to put on another mans shoe.</p>

<p>We could say that the limit of another man in being truthful of the true nature of something is limited by his own existance. That, he could not possibly understand the true nature of every thing under the sun. Our time is limited, our consiousness bound to itself, only existing in that of itself. If I am consious, therefore, I cannot become unconsious. If I am a human, I cannot be an animal. If I am living, I cannot be dead. So our lack of knowledge exists in the external state of all other possible states our consious could take on. I cannot understand what breathing water is like, as I'm rendered unable to. Because I cannot understand breathing water, who am I to know what's best for the fish who boasts at me, mockingly, with his gills? Am I fit to know what his diet should consist of, or where he should find his mate, or under what conditions it's okay for the fish to swim? How am I to go about asking the fish?</p>

<p>Similarly, which man is fit to declare what is proper for another man? Or in the broader abstraction of the inquiry, is any man fit to declare anything? I'm unable to answer the prior, so I will attempt at my reason twords the latter. A man is able to declare the "what is" definitions of his observations. He can see a color and call it by its name. A man also is fit in interpretations of his enviorment. The traffic light is red, so that means I must stop. However, these are mere byproducts of the act of observation.</p>

<p>No one can impose on the observation of a man, unless he blinds him or kills him. Therefore, a man will always be observing. Now we could ask: if all observations are natural and are of the same nature, why is it that some understand their observations differently? If I'm driving and I observed a red light, and officer BakonBytz also observes the same red light, why do I press the gas while he holds his brake? I interpreted the light as meaning go, because red means fire, and fire is produced in the combustion of the pistons in my cars engine. So naturally, I see red, and I act like a bull: charging forward. I also am unaware of what deputy BakonBytz is interpreting. Because of this, I don't waste my interpretations on attempting to understand his interpretation: it's impossible to arrive at, we have two seperate minds. It also is more rational to be consumed with making my interpretations aimed at being "true", rather than determining if others interpretations are "true": we both fall short.</p>

<p>Therefore, no man is able to interpret for another. Each interpretation is a byproduct of one's consiousness, and each consiousness submits only to its own observations and interpretations. So it would be near impossible to impose any interpreation for a man, because he cannot help but arrive at an understanding unique to him. Thus, every happening is equally subject to each mans understanding.</p>

<p>Because there are an infinite amount of interpretations for a given observation, could the observation be true itself? How do I'm not living in a dream, yet to wake? I close my eyes, they open. When they are open, my eyes open yet again upon waking from a dream. I arrise and proceed on with the day, not questioning wheteher my eyes are going to be opened yet again - it's impossible, just as it would be inside a dream to ask the same.</p>

<p>There must be some agreement upon what we see? From the previous declaration, the only true agreement must be that we cannot possibly agree on the "what is". It is beyond our existance that we would be able to determine the reality, so it's more rational to carry on in this uncertainty than to fret on it: neither action increases our understanding. </p>

<p>So who is to say what is good, or true, or just, or right? Whose to say what's evil or pure? Whose to say when a man is justified, or unjustified? No man. Although many sit upon the throne of God to cast the judgement, they all are subject to the same: whose to say if they are justified in their own justifications? As one may notice, this spirals all the way to hell, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Order, rule, law, conduct, ethics: all creations of mankind, attempting to gain truth on whats fit for a man. These things are all the product of the collaboration of many minds to seek out the truth in all things. That, lo, we may not be able to fully ever arrive at the truth, this is our best possible attempt - all that a man is able to do, arriving at the limits of our consiousness. </p>

<p>Yet, these understandings should be understood for what they really are: collaborative interpretations of what a man is justified in doing. They offer no support for what a man should do, but rather answer the question of "what is our best possible guess at the truth?". Yet, as we had arrived at earlier, all interpretations of an observation are unique to the mind it sprung from.</p>

<p>Should we treat these "laws" then by ultimate, unfalliable truths? If you beleive man is capable of understanding and filling the role of God, by all means. Yet, who also equally climbs the throne?</p>

<p>A rapist deems he is fit to overtake a woman and is justified. A murderer deems he is correct in killing, regarding himself justified. A robber beleives the object never belonged to another, so he takes what he pleases. A tyrant deems what is fit for his people, on their behalf, so they don't have to worry about it. A priest justified in touching Sunday school children, because it isn't a woman and doesn't break his celibacy. A teacher telling pupils what is true, important, relevant and what they 'ought to do. A father beating a childs mother, knowing she 'ought to know her place in the house. A young man forcing a woman to his will; it's subject to his interpretation as being what he's observed to be correct, so where is his error? Who is fit to call his action, or his error, justified or unjustified?</p>

<p>Who guides ones steps? Who is to judge a writers work, but himself? In the latter case, the audience; who it was intended for. All the same to a man writing a letter, sealing it in an envelope and sending it to the desired recepient. If it be his father, mother, son, daughter, friend, enemy, slave, master: it makes no difference to the postman, he merley delivers it. The interpretation by the recepient of the letter, is that not what matters to the writer? Similarly the purpose of the postman in delivering the message, is it not all for the purpose of the end receipent?</p>

<p>When the sun falls and moon rises, the heads hit the pillow: two minds become one in the delivery of the message. That is the hope. That is the goal. So both may join in a shared state of mind, whereby their interpretations of the same observations become one in the same. Thus, the hope is no longer to evaluate each interpretation and apply ones understanding: rather, they both are made complete in sharing the same truth, understanding, reality, heart, mind, spirit, through the same method of interpretation as delivered in the letter. Thus, rooting ad infinitum past the meer "observation" and is exactly the truth. What is left then?Nothing of the flesh, only spirit. The spirit that operates on its own, outside of the flesh. Whereby it is complete, because it doesn't rely on the flesh. </p>

<p>Or one might also say: the word became flesh.</p>
