  From a young persons perspective, the world can seem like an oppressive monster or a bountiful opportunity. 
  In either case, the observer is correct. From all pillars in ones life: relationships, career, hobbies, social, status and the rest. 
  In my lifetime, I’ve come to recognize this universal truth: there is a tradeoff between time invested without return and future payouts. 
  Every day we gamble today for tomorrow.

One hopes for the paycheck at the end of the week by going to work today. One hopes for the sale after spending hours with a client. An artist paints in hopes one day for the paintings exposure. Yet in all of this, the common thread is patience. Time is held constant, while balanced on a universal axiom of change.

We as young Americans, or global citizens for that matter, must decide what’s important to us all. Each individual is entitled to choosing what they deem fit for their life. Whether this be as an artist, a writer, a salesman, a wife, the principle remains the same: we get to actively choose what it is we’d like to become.

Many stand confused, naturally, at where they should fit into the world. I say to hell with it, none of us belong here anyway. With that in mind, let’s enjoy our brief moment in time of existence we have and choose what seems right to us all.

I once had been locked in my own jail of limitation, as never thinking anything besides what was in front of me was possible. I still hold myself in this jail, yet at least recognizing it is a step forward. Although it holds true, we must deal with the cards we’re dealt, understandably, the more often we play the cards the better our luck becomes. We don’t get to choose our cards, but we do have the decision at what table we would like to sit at in life.

Now, unlike poker, the longer you sit at a certain table in life, the more handsome the returns become. I’ve understood this phenomenon to be leverage. If I play my hand at writing for 5 years, I will be therefore better than one starting today. This phenomenon of superiority is often taken from the onlookers externally as envy, where one falsely believes it takes superhuman talent to reach a particular spot in life. This is the lie we are all sold.

When we were little, being told “we can be whatever we want” was true. Even to the day today. Picking a corporate job works this way. The longer you stay, the higher the pay. An artist is this way. The longer one paints, the better ones artwork becomes. The longer a salesmen sells, the better he becomes.
</p>

This principle of patience allows one to put themselves in any type of position in life. Although natural talent raises the starting platform, the work eventually shows for itself. The seeds planted become trees that give life, overtime. So the question changes from not what you want to become, but what are you willing to do over the course of 5-10 years without any compensation. This question should be the primary one asked of kids. In Robert Greenes book, Mastery, it talks about how it requires this long of a duration to become a true master at something. Once the time is put it, you hold the skill.

Younger tend to never realize this axiom until it’s too late. The older realize this, yet never choose to accept it - falsely thinking it’s too late for them to start on their journey of mastery of a particular vocation. I believe that money is the great influencer on this. People are often scared and confused, so following the mob and the money is always the strongest indicator for most. It takes great courage to veer from the path most taken and carve a new one. This feat is immensely hard. Yet, this boils down to your fundamental philosophy on life: is it worth it?
