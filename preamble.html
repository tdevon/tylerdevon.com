  <h1>A Preamble To The Highest Possible Form Of Good</h1>
  <h4>Tyler H. Devon. 03-27-20.</h4>
  <hr/>

<p>In the pursuit of searching and oreitning of ones "self" twords manifesting the highest possible form of good, the definition of "good" in question is not a constant with another "self". For we all are born with natural talents, desires, aptitudes, intellegence, personalities and systems of thinking - all of which fundamentally unique to us. Further, every person is then raised within an enviorment that shapes who they are. This experience is equally unique to every individual, as that individual is the first among the human race to ever be subject to that environment, at that time, through the scope of their natural traits. 
</p>

<p>No other individual would ever be able to truly emulate another persons experience. Even if one were to narriate both their entire collective expereince and their perception of what natural traits they subject their worldview to, the ability for any other being to look through that same lense remains impossible. The trenches carved in the consious of whom is native to that experience are irrevocably engrained into their manifestation of existance. Regardless of time, they will forver be the sole individual to partake in that experience. 
</p>

<p>Taken to the extreme of infinite realities, a reality beyond our fold is differtiated to our reality by either both their existance in of itself or by some charactaristic of its manifestation. As in order for another possible reality to truly exist, it by definition, must differ in some form. Thus, if one were to search through all of these infinite realities of possibility, you would eventually retrace your journey back to the ground on which you stand: realizing you are the only being to ever experience the infinitley impossible consiousness of "you".</p>

<p>If reality was tasked with producing you again, it simply would not be able to do so, for all of enternity. The very fact of your mere existance, in of itself, defies the laws which reality operates. Up until you became manifested into existance, it remained against the very laws of nature for you to exist. Moreover, just a notion of the idea of you was equally impossible to arrive at.</p>

<p>One should dutily recognize the beauty and infinetly intrisic value of their being. Of even existing itself. Each individual then, by nature, holds within them an inifite intrisic value that is unparallel to any other individual. Their fundamental nature itself is impossible to ever duplicate. Regardless of any possible action that individual takes within its existance, none could ever match or surpass the value of the nature of that individual simply existing.</p>

<p>Should we then ascribe ourselves to entitlement, praise and remaining static within our existance? Never, nothing could be further from the truth! If one simply refuses to operate within their existance, by justifying that being via the fact of existance itself is enough, all of the infinite qualities of impossibility and value of that individual is then lost. It is the infinite possibilities that one represents, in juxtaposition to what reality is, that derives irreplacable value. One must actually submit to reality in order to attain the formentioned boundless qualities. 
</p>

<p>Thus, one simoutaniously maintains a state of both opposition and agreement with the fabric of reality. If an individual arrives at this state, then the actions they take become the source of juxtaposition to the same infinite value of the collective reality shared among all beings, while becoming the root of value for an individual themselves. 
</p>

<p>As it is from the infinite value that the individiual represents that all actions that interact with reality are ascribed value. Picking up an object is valued, only because the object therefore then is in unison with the same form of infinite value. The individual simply passes on their state to the object, via an action, as the actions occurance shares the same state of the individuals existance: both in an asynchronus state of opposition and submission to reality, due to the impossibility of reality alone producing either.</p>

<p>So, what task has reality ascribed the individual to? What could one call good then, given the existance of an unmatchable value? Whatever it is that whomever possesses that value assigns themselves to do. For through whatever action the individual sees "good" to take, it becomes "good" due to the judgement against an infinite value. If something represents the greatest possible value, and it becomes subject to something other than itself, the very thing that it becomes subject to then surpasses the orignially thought "greatest possible value." It is in the same manor that one does not purchase an item, unless they beleive the item is worth more than the cost of the purchase.</p>

<p>The buyer takes with them the wishful thinking, which is ascribed to the purchased item. The buyer could equally enter into a second exchange with that same item, carrying along the same nature of the original hope, allowing for another exchange to be made possible because of it. The secondhand buyer is able to arive at the same wishful thinking, due to the initial purchase requiring the same wishful thinking. The sellers gain is the cost of the intial buyer, which is equally ascribed value due to the initial wishful thinking. So the seller is able to enter a second exchange in the same manor as the buyer.</p>

<p>The assessor may be incorrect. They may very well be walking on mere thin ice of wishful thinking and hope. Yet, because the assessor beleives their natural convictions to derive some form of truth, they wager against all logic, reason and sanity that reality defines. It is this very wager that defines the value that carries on - the item is worth the same as the cost of getting it, after the exchange.</p>

<p>Let every individual then become the assigner and keeper of all things ascribed good. If an individual inquires to see what is the highest form of good, they then should aptly do the precise form of what they beleive it to be. Now, that does not mean it becomes the only definition for good, nor will always be constant for that individual. </p>

<p>Rather, it is through the interaction with the once thought form of good that we arrive unto a new defintiion of being: one greater than a previous self, the self that did not pursue what they saw to be good. Because the individual ascribed to something value greater than their own, it is then that the manifestation and fruition of that thing which redefines the value of the individual. </p>

<p>If I say my worth is $100 and I define some objects worth as $500, then if I become the owner of that object, my value then increases by $500. Thus, it is then that I beco me able to conceive of another object worth $600 and below the worth of $600, as I was once worth $100 and now am worth $600; equally, I am then deem fit to define what is worth more than myself, the $600. </p>

<p>It is with this ladder one climbs to the peak of the highest form of good; infintley surmounting to greater heights, as the dynamic between the assignment and pursuit represents the continual process of pursuing the highest possible form of good.</p>

<p>There we can deduct that it is the resposibility of an individual aspiring to partake in journey to manifest good, to decide where that journey lies. Because of the inability for the uniqueness of each individual to be replicated, then the qualities that each partaker possesses should integrate into their own individual journey; the journey then becomes equally as valueable as the individual. The individual, then, through their own juxtaposition to reality, gives equally back to reality to fufill the very nature of that juxtaposition.</p>

<p>The impossibility of the existance of the individual becomes possible through their integration into a redefined reality, in which they create. They become possible by creating a new redefinition of the possible reality they exist in, within accordance to the impossibility of the nature of their very being. It is with that new reality the juxtaposition is reversed: laws of nature become impossible, and all that was once impossible becomes the new natural fabric of that reality. </p>

<p>Through the same process that this new reality will infinitley add to the once collective laws of the shared, original reality - allowing for the process to continually carry through in both infinite time and infinite possibility. It is this responsibility of torchbearing that both reality and being infinitley allow for eachothers existance. It is this responsibility that is most fit for mankind. It is this responsibility that is the only one fit for mankind.</p>
